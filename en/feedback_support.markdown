## Known problems

* If a filename has some nasty characters in it, the file is ignored.
* On Mac OS X computers it may be that the wrong Java version is selected. The program will then only run for a second and close again immediately after being started. Start the 'Java Settings' (Applications -> Utilities) and move the latest Java version (Java 7) to the top of the list to fix it. If there is no version 7 of Java you probably have to update your operating system to obtain it. Or use a legacy version of the software.
* On Linux, the pre-listen function only plays music if there is no other audio source active on the system.
* On Windows (64 bit), if it is not possible to generate long compilations even there is enough RAM, most likely the 32 bit version of Java is currently active. Use the 64 bit version of Java to start the program.
